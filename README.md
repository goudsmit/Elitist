## About <a name = "about"></a>

Elitist is a companion app to use when playing [Elite: Dangerous](https://elitedangerous.com/).
It's purpose is initially for personal development, as well as allowing better display of in-game information. It displays better system information, bodies in a system, credits, materials and more in a one-page view.
It's optimized for a portrait screen currently, but there is a plan to make it more responsive.
